Ladies and gentlemen, at this moment, the whole world is focused on me, i'm going to introduce myself.
I am a student from JIMEI university, grade 3, computer specialty. While i am interested in billiards and PC games. 
But it's not limit to these. I'm interested in many things, though i don't know much about it.
At last, i hope i can pass a happy and full time during college time. God bless me.
